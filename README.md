# Pong-Soccer
 Pong is an arcade game with a table tennis theme and 2D graphics, developed by Atari and released in 1972. It is one of the first arcade games. We updated Pong using JavaScript and other languages to create a minigame with a soccer theme, keeping the simple gameplay and adding modern elements.
